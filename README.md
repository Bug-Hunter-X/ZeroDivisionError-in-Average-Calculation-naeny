# ZeroDivisionError in Python Average Calculation

This repository demonstrates a common programming error in Python: the `ZeroDivisionError`. The error occurs when trying to divide a number by zero. This often happens when working with lists or arrays that might be empty.

The `bug.py` file contains the code that produces this error. The `bugSolution.py` file shows how to handle the error gracefully using conditional statements to check if the list is empty before performing the division.
